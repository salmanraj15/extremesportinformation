	<p id="content2">Thats enough of talking about myself in the third person.At first I intended to be an animator and started experimenting on animation generators, fully motivated to become just that.<br> One thing led to another and 2 years of my degree life had past and now here i am as a fully fledged freelance web designer without ever planning to become one.
		 This fortunate turn of events has lead me to design websites for many people inside and outside college. To work with people from all over the world is very rewarding.<br> My keen interests in programming and debugging have pushed me forward towards developping new websites with "NEVER SEEEN BEFORE" looks.
         I have sucessfully been a freelance web designer now for a while and it has given me even more love for this work.
         I have coded websites with great respect to standards, because it makes life easier for everybody. My site even validates, honestly, have a look. And so when I realised I had to a website as a project I was very thrilled. My team members are mentioned above. You can know about them too.<br>If you like our work and want to hire us, feel free to <a href="#">CONTACT US</a></p>
