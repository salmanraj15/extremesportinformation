						<img class="img1" src="images/me2.jpg" height="300" width="300">
                        <p>When i joined college i showed keen interest in programming.One thing led to another and 2 years of my degree life had past and now here i am as a fully fledged freelance web designer without ever planning to become one.
		                   This fortunate turn of events has lead me to design websites for many people inside and outside college. To work with people from all over the world is very rewarding.<br> My keen interests in programming and debugging have pushed me forward towards developping new websites with "NEVER SEEEN BEFORE" looks.
						   I have sucessfully been a freelance web designer now for a while and it has given me even more love for this work.
						   I have coded websites with great respect to standards, because it makes life easier for everybody. My site even validates, honestly, have a look. And so when I realised I had to a website as a project I was very thrilled. My team members are mentioned above. You can know about them too.<br>If you like our work and want to hire us, feel free to <p class="link"><a href="#">CONTACT US</a></p>

                        <p>“I am the Prince of my own”“I say what I want, I do what I want, I get what I want”.“I am who I am, if you can’t accept me as that. You don’t deserve my time”.“I know what things are good: friendship and work and conversation. These I shall have”.“My friends hug me tight, when I am feeling low”.My friends bring a smile to my face; just by being there”.“I love me, I am who I am, I do what makes me happy. I live for me,
not you. U may not agree with me…but I m not seeking your approval. I
am happy with all that I am”.“Its funny, you THINK that you know me just by viewing my page, but sweetie you have no ides”!!“I am good, But not an angel. I do sin, but I am no the devil. I have friends, but I am not the
peacemaker.“I am always a mess. I can never keep my own secrets. I laugh too
hard at stupid things. I live in the past, in the memories. I have with
the people I love. I am heartsick for all the things. I can’t get back.
It’s hard for me to define myself. I guess I’m just a cliché, the
person who loved too hard and didn’t get anything in return. I just
want the one person who has never given me a second thought”.“I am different I am just me”.</p>

                        <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>

                        <p>You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft encounters a black hole does the computer call it an 'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.</p>

						<p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing. </p>
